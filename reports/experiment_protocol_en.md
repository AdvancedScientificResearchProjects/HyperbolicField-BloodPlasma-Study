# Experiment Protocol: Hyperbolic Field Blood Plasma Study

## Setup
- 7 donors, blood → centrifuge (2000 RPM, 5 min) → plasma separation
- Plasma from 4 tubes → combined → split into 4 samples:
  - 2 control (not irradiated, placed 1.5m from emitters)
  - 1 sample in **channel 19** emitter (**time acceleration**)
  - 1 sample in **channel 21** emitter (**time deceleration**)
- Irradiation duration: ~1h12m
- Volume: 1ml per sample (some had 1.5ml)
- Temperature: 17°C constant (smart home system)

## Channel Mapping
- **ch0 / control** — no irradiation, baseline
- **ch19** — time acceleration (hyperbolic field, channel 19)
- **ch21** — time deceleration (hyperbolic field, channel 21)

## Photography
- iPhone camera (HEIC format, converted to JPG)
- Backlight from below (LED panel)
- Glass test tubes
- Lab environment with artificial lighting

## Key Observations
- **ch19 (acceleration)**: clot forms fast, then starts decomposing (lysis)
- **ch21 (deceleration)**: dense clot, slow formation
- 2 donors on antibiotics → problematic plasma (fast coagulation during centrifuging)

## Data
- 7 patients (patient-01 through patient-07)
- 101 photos total
- 40 single-channel: 13 control + 14 ch19 + 13 ch21
- 24 multi-channel: 20 (all three channels) + 4 (ch19+ch21)
